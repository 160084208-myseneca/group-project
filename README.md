## Hows This Game Works

1. This script imports the random module and creates a list of valid options: rock, paper, and scissors.
2. This script enters a loop to play multiple rounds. Within the loop:
3. This script uses random.choice() to select a random option from the list for the computer.
4. This script asks the user to input their choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
5. This script checks if the user input is valid. If it's not, the program asks the user to try again.
6. This script prints the user's and computer's options.
7. This script determines the winner based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
8. This script asks the user if they want to play again. If the user inputs no, the loop breaks.
9. This script thanks the user for playing when the loop ends.

## Issues

The issue of this script is that it doesnt prompt the user if he wants to play again or if he wants to continue the game, this script will just continue to loop the same rock/paper/scissors game and to fix this issue i need to create a exit statement depedning on if the user wants to continue to play another round
